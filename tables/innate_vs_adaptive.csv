Feature;Signification
specificity;Each epitope of an antigen is associated to its own immune response and lymphocyte. 
memory;In case of second exposure with the same pathogen, heightened response over a longer range of time
diversity;Enables to fend off a large repertoire of pahtogens, including newly encountered antigens. 
clonal expansion;Increase of the very lymphocyte targetting the epitopes of the intruder. 
specialisation;Optimal pathway in relation with the nature of the vector (oversimplified, plasma cells target directly bacterias, while TCD8 kill cells hosting virus or tumoral cells).
nonreactivity to self;The adaptive immunity induces mechanisms of tolerance to innocuous foreign substances. Besides, their unwanted side effects against heathy tissues are considerably alleviated compared to innate cells.
